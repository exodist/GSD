        A GSD module represents a single namespace (also called a package).
        Installed modules will be stored in tar.gz files that contain all the
        files related to the module. Only one namespace can be defined in a
        module.
        <p>

        Module tarballs must include the version number in their filename. In
        GSD version numbers are always 3 numbers seperated by period.
        <p>

        Module tarballs are placed in the library path (example /usr/lib/gsd).
        When a module namespace has multiple parts, each part except the last
        is a subdir, the last part is the tarball name.

        <pre class="example">
    Foo::Bar::Baz - libdir/Foo/Bar/Baz.5.2.36.tgz
        </pre>

        <p>
        For development purposes a dev_lib may be specified, module loading
        always checks the dev_lib first, and the modules are expected to be
        extracted, not in tgz form.

        In GSD a package is a namespace. A namespace is essentially a
        collection of named symbols, under the hood it is a dictionary or hash
        table. Any type of symbol may be defined within a package.
        <p>
        Unlike perl, a package does not double as a class. In GSD you can
        define custom types, a package may have any number of types defined
        within it. GSD uses the term 'type' instead of 'class'.
        <p>
        A package path and filename must match the package name, and have the
        .gsd extension.
        <pre class="example">
    Foo::Bar::Baz - devlib/Foo/Bar/Baz.gsd
        </pre>
        <p>
        A package can be split into multiple include files. Include files can
        only belong to one package. Include files go into a subdir with the
        name of the package, and must end in .gsi. Each include file must
        define exactly 1 symbol for the package. The filename of the include
        file must be the symbol name.

        <pre class="example">
    devlib/Foo/Bar/
        Baz.gsd
        Baz/
            do_this.gsi
            do_that.gsi
            my_type.gsi
        </pre>

        Include files are loaded automatically when the symbol they define is
        needed. However when the module is loaded a list of available include
        files is obtained, this way it is possible to check if a package has a
        symbol, even if it has not yet been loaded.

        <p>

        When a package is turned into a .tgz this directory structure must be
        preserved.

        When possible a gsd program should not have an extension, instead the
        #! line should be used. If you are on a system where #! is not used, or
        if you feel compelled to use an extention, .gsp should be used.
        <p>
        There are no restrictions on where a GSD program should live.
        <p>
        GSD program files consist of a #! line, a header, and then a body. The
        #! line must be the first line. The header comes after the #! line (no
        empty lines between the #! and the header. Each line of the header
        should be a key/vaue pair seperated by a colon. Leading whitespace is
        stripped from header values. Header keys are not case-sensitive. The
        header and body are seperated by 1 or more empty lines.
        <p>
        These headers are manditory:
        <dl>
            <dt>version</dt>
            <dd>Version of the program</dd>
            <dt>name</dt>
            <dd>Name of the program</dd>
            <dt>gsd version</dt>
            <dd>Minimum GSD version necessary to run the program</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>

        Example:
        <pre style="example">
    #!/usr/bin/gsd
    name:    My Program
    version: 1.2.3
    gsd version: 0.0.1

    ...GSD CODE GOES HERE...
