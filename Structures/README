== Features ===

 * Designed for concurrency, any numbers of threads can read and write
 * Allows you to handle pathological data by providing alternate meta-data and
   rebuilding the entire dictionary (This can be used to change a hash seed).
 * Uses a hash table with customizable number of slots
 * Each hash slot uses a binary tree for keys that use the same slot (hash
   conflicts)
 * You specify how deep a tree imbalance should be before it is balanced
 * Each slots tree will be independantly balanced if an imbalance is detected
 * Can use anything as keys and values
   * You specify how to compare keys (for sorting, for the trees)
   * You specify how to get a slot number (hash key) for a key
   * Can provide a callback for reference counting on keys and values.
 * Can use the 'reference' feature to tie several keys together
   (updating the value of one key is reflected in all keys)
   * References can also be made between different dictionaries.
 * Each dictionary can have custom metadata associated with it for use in your
   compare and update functions.
