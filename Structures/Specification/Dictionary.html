<h2 id="guarentees">Guarentees</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        The internal state of the dictionary will always remain consistent, even in the
        event of errors, so long as the API is used correctly.
    </li>

    <li>
        Any number of threads may access the dictionary for reading and/or writing
        without introducing errors.
    </li>

    <li>
        The only operation that will ever block is inserting new keys.
    </li>

    <li>
        Reading and Updating keys will never block.
    </li>

    <li>
        If 2 threads modify the value of the same key, the dictionary will guarentee
        that reads in either thread after the update will get one value or the other,
        not the original value, and not an invalid or combination value.
    </li>

    <li>
        The dictionary does not suffer from the A-B-A problem internally. However the
        provided compare-and-swap operations do not solve the A-B-A problem in your own
        code.
    </li>

    <li>
        When ref-counting is used, the ref count of a key or value will always be
        bumped by 1 before it is returned to you.

        When ref-counting is used, it is fine to have one thread remove a value while
    </li>

    <li>
        another reads it. The refcount bump by the read will ALWAYS happen before the
        refcount drop from the removal.<br/> (However there is no guarentee that the read
        will happen before the removal, this guarentee is only for cases where it
        does.)
    </li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2 id="callbacks">Callbacks</h2>

<h3 id="required_callbacks">Required Callbacks</h3>

<pre style="code">int dict_cmp( void *meta, void *key1, void *key2, uint8_t *error );</pre>

Used to check if 2 keys are equivilent (0), otherwise used to position them in
a tree (-1 or 1).

<p>

void *meta is the metadata pointer attached to the dictionary. This is not used
by the dictionary internally, but is provided by the API for your use.

<p>

You are free to return any error code you would like, it will eventually be
accessible via the return object when an operation triggers it.

<hr>
<pre style="code">size_t dict_loc( size_t slot_count, void *meta, void *key, uint8_t *error );</pre>

Used to locate a key in a hashtable. Should return a number between 0 and
slot_count.

<p>

void *meta is the metadata pointer attached to the dictionary. This is not used
by the dictionary internally, but is provided by the API for your use.

<p>

You are free to return any error code you would like, it will eventually be
accessible via the return object when an operation triggers it.

<p>

This callback is typically as hashing algorithm.

<hr>
<h3 id="optional_callbacks">Optional Callbacks</h3>

<pre style="code">void dict_change( dict *d, void *meta, void *key, void *old_val, void *new_val );</pre>

This is for metadata maintenance. It will trigger whenever a key changes value.
It will give you the new and old values. One will be undef if the key is being
inserted or deleted.

<p>

<b>NOTE: This should NOT be used for reference counting.</b>

<hr>
<pre style="code">void dict_ref( dict *d, void *ref, int delta );</pre>

This is mainly for reference counting. This is called whenever the number of
references to [void *ref] is changed. [int delta] may be positive, negative, or
even 0. The delta is the refcount change (add it to your refcount).


<hr>
<h3 id="other_callbacks">Other Callbacks</h3>

<hr>
<pre style="code">int dict_handler( void *key, void *value, void *args );</pre>

This callback is used when iterating over all values in a dictionary. The args
pointer is for your use, when you start the iteration you can provide a value
for it that gets passed in every time the handler is called.

<hr>
<pre style="code">const char *dict_trigger( void *arg, void *value );</pre>

A trigger, along with an argument, can be attached to a key. When the value is
changed for a key the trigger will be called. If there is no problem the
trigger should return NULL. If there is a problem the trigger should return an
error message which will block the operation.

<hr>
<pre style="code">char * dict_dot( void *key, void *val );</pre>

Used to let you specify how keys and values should be represented in graphviz
format.

<hr>
<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<pre style="code">
struct dict_methods {
    dict_cmp    *cmp;
    dict_loc    *loc;
    dict_change *change;
    dict_ref    *ref;
};
</pre>

The dict_methods structure is where you define all your callbacks. The first 2
(cmp and loc) are required, the others are optional. See the Callbacks section
for more details.

<hr>
<pre style="code">
struct dict_settings {
    size_t slot_count;
    size_t max_imbalance;
    void *meta;
};
</pre>

The slot_count sets the number of hash slots in the base hash-table of the
dictionary. Setting this number higher will consume more memory regardless of
how many keys and values are present.

<p>

The max_imbalance specifies how imbalanced a binary tree inside the dictionary
may become before a rebalance occurs. A rebalance is one of the few operations
that can block insertions, and can be an expensive operation. Rouch (and
unscientific) benchmarking tends to show that setting this low degrades
performance. A value of 16 is recommended at this time.

<p>

The meta pointer is for your use, it will be passed into callbacks. There are
no restrictions on what you can shove in the meta pointer. It is also not
required, set it to NULL if you have no use for it.

<hr>
<pre style="code">
struct dict_merge_settings {
    enum {
        MERGE_SET,
        MERGE_INSERT,
        MERGE_UPDATE,
    } operation;

    uint8_t reference;
};
</pre>

The dict_merge_settings structure is used to specify how a merge operation should work.

<p>

The operation enum lets you specify how values in the 'from' hash should be put
into the destination hash.

<dl>
    <dt>MERGE_SET</dt>
    <dd>
        All values in the 'from' dictionary will be put into the destination
        dictionary, overriding existing values if they are already present.
    </dd>

    <dt>MERGE_INSERT</dt>
    <dd>
        Values in the 'from' dictionary will be inserted into the destination
        dictionaty unless a value is already defined for the given key in the
        destination dictionary.
    </dd>

    <dt>MERGE_UPDATE</dt>
    <dd>
        Values in the 'from' dictionary will override values for the given key
        in the destination dictionary. If a key is present in the 'from'
        dictionary, but not in the 'dest' dictionary, it will not be inserted.
    </dd>
<dl>

The reference flag, when true, will cause the operation to make references
between the 2 dictionaries instead of simply setting the values. This means
that future updates to either hash will effect both (for keys that have been
merged).

<hr>
<h2 id="building">Creating, Destroying, and Utility</h2>

<pre style="code">dict *dict_build( size_t slots, dict_methods m, void *meta );</pre>

This is the quickest way to build a dictionary. You do not need to make a
settings hash, most values will be set for you from defaults. NULL will be
returned in the event of an error, there is no way to know what error occured.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict_stat dict_create( dict **d, dict_settings settings, dict_methods methods );</pre>

This is the long, but safer way to build a dictionary. In the event of an error
*d will be set to NULL. The returned stat object will contain any errors that
occured.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict_stat dict_merge( dict *from, dict *to, dict_merge_settings s, size_t threads );</pre>

This lets you put the keys+values from one dictionary into another. See the
Configuration section for details of the dict_merge_settings structure. The
merge operation is parallelizable, so you may specify how many threads should
be used.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict *dict_clone( dict *d, uint8_t reference, size_t threads );</pre>

This lets you clone a dictionary. This can be a shallow-clone (keys+values) or
it can be a linked clone (keys are referenced between the dictionary). This is
parallelizable, so you can specify how many threads should be used.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict_stat dict_free( dict **d );</pre>

Used to free a dictionary and all its internal structures. *d will be set to
NULL when complete.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict_settings dict_get_settings( dict *d );</pre>

Get the settings structure used by the dictionary.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict_methods dict_get_methods( dict *d );</pre>

Get the methods structure used by the dictionary.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict *dict_clone_immutable( dict *d, size_t threads );</pre>

Same as dict_clone, except that the new dictionary is immutable.

<hr>
<pre style="code">char *dict_dump_dot( dict *d, dict_dot *decode );</pre>

Returns a string that is a graphviz dot formated representation of the
dictionary.

<hr>
<h2 id="operations">Dictionary Operations</h2>

Note: See the Structures document for the definition of 'dict_stat'.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict_stat dict_reconfigure( dict *d, dict_settings settings, size_t max_threads );</pre>

This will let you change the settings of a dictionary such as adding or
decreasing the slot count. This is parallelizable, so you can specify how many
threads to use. During the reconfiguration, insertion operations in other
threads will block, but updates and reads will continue as expected.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict_stat dict_rebalance( dict *d, size_t threads );</pre>

This is a way to force a rebalance of all trees inside the dictionary. This is
a parallelizable task, so you may specify a thread count. During the rebalance
some insertions in other threads may block. Updates and reads will not block.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict_stat dict_get( dict *d, void *key, void **val );</pre>

Get will retrieve the value for the specified key. If the key is not present
then the value returned is NULL.

<p>

A get operation will never block. A get operation may fail if the API is
misued, or if memory runs out.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict_stat dict_set( dict *d, void *key, void *val );</pre>

Set will assign a value to the specified key. Set will update the value if the
key is already present, otherwise it will insert the key.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict_stat dict_insert( dict *d, void *key, void *val );</pre>

Insert will put both the key and the value into the dictionary. The insert will
return a transaction error if the key is already present in the dictionary.
This is thread-safe, if 2 threads attempt to insert the key, only one will
succeed.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict_stat dict_update( dict *d, void *key, void *val );</pre>

Update will set the value of a key that is already present in the dictionary.
If the key is not present than the operation will return a transaction error.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict_stat dict_delete( dict *d, void *key );</pre>

Delete will remove a key (and value) from the dictionary, that is that an
insertion or set will be required to put the key back into the dictionary, as
well get operations will return NULL.

<p>

NOTE: delete is a 'soft' operation, the key may not actually be removed from
the dictionary, and the refcount may not change. This is because a the key may
be referenced, in which case a new insertion should effect the reference, even
if the key was deleted.

<p>

NOTE: To actually full remove a key from a dictionary use the dereference
operation.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict_stat dict_cmp_update( dict *d, void *key, void *old_val, void *new_val );</pre>

This is an atomic compare-and-swap operation. It works just like the update
operation, except that the old_value must match for the update to occur. If
something else updates the value before this then the operatin will return a
transaction error.

<p>

NOTE: There is no internal A-B-A problem here, but your code still needs to be
aware of possible A-B-A problems.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict_stat dict_cmp_delete( dict *d, void *key, void *old_val );</pre>

This is an atomic compare-and-swap deletion operation. It is just like delete
except that it will only succeed if the value matched old_val. This operation
will fail if something else changes the value first.

NOTE: There is no internal A-B-A problem here, but your code still needs to be
aware of possible A-B-A problems.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict_stat dict_reference( dict *orig, void *okey, dict *dest, void *dkey );</pre>

This lets you link multiple keys. That is both keys will have the same value,
if you update one the other reflects the change. References can be made between
multiple dictionaries as well.

<p>

NOTE: If you reference between 2 dictionaries that have different dict_methods
then the results are undefined.... DO NOT DO IT!

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict_stat dict_dereference( dict *d, void *key );</pre>

Remove a reference. This actually removes the key from the dictionary, unlike
delete which is a soft-removal.

<p>

NOTE: A rebalance is still necessary for the key to be removed from the
internal structure of the dictionary, so the refcount drop may not happen
immedietly.

<hr>
<pre style="code">dict_stat dict_insert_trigger( dict *d, void *key, dict_trigger *t, void *targ, void *val );</pre>

This is an insert operation that will also attach a trigger callback+arg to a
specific key. Same rules and guarentees as a regular insert operation.

<hr>
<pre style="code">int dict_iterate( dict *d, dict_handler *h, void *args );</pre>

This will iterate over every key and value present in the dictionary. The
handler 'h' will be called for each key+value pair.

<p>

NOTE: Keys inserted into the dictionary, or removed from it, after the iteration
begins may not be seen.
