        GSD was concieved to be a language in the spirit of perl. The idea is
        to make a new language that carries over the good things from perl5,
        but also improves things that are not ideal in perl5. This is similar
        to the idea behind perl6, the main difference being that GSD should
        have a very light core. We intend to focus on writing a small core that
        makes anything possible, without actually trying to implement
        EVERYTHING in core.

        <h3>On Perl5</h3>
        There is a lot that Perl5 does right, it is a very successful language.
        However Perl5 is in many ways stuck in the past. There are many things
        in Perl5 that are just tacked on, such as OOP. There are many things
        taken for granted in most modern languages that just aren't there in
        perl.

        <h3>On Perl6</h3>
        Perl6 is to perl5 as C++ is to C. Those that know me will understand
        that this is not a compliment. Perl6 is huge, too big for most people
        to understand more than a fraction of it. This size and complexity has
        contributed to the fact that after any years there is still not a truly
        useful Perl6 implementation. In fact at the time of this writing, the
        spec is not even complete.

        <h3> On GSD </h3>
        With GSD the goal is the focus on writing a language that enables
        developers. A language that can be extended as necessary using third
        party modules. To this end GSD will support custom syntax through
        definable keywords. The language will also have a few simple rules for
        how it is parsed.

        The GSD specification should be small enough that a single developer,
        or small group could implement it in a reasonable time frame. Extended
        features and capabilities should be created as third party modules.

        Backwords compatability with perl5 is not a primary goal of GSD, but it
        is a secondary goal. The syntax and internal structures of GSD do now
        allow for perl5 code to "just work", however it is possible to map much
        of perl5 to gsd. See the 'Mapping perl5' page.

        GSD <b>MUST</b> focus on the following if it is truly to be a modern language, and a
        successor to perl.

        <ul>
            <li>Concurrency and Parallelism</li>
            <li>Support for many paradigms: OOP, Functional, Imperetive, DCI</li>
            <li>Parsing hooks (Think perl5's Devel::Declare, but not as a hack)</li>
            <li>Full unicode support</li>
            <li>Consistent versioning of core and modules</li>
            <li>Try to maintain the spirit of perl5, but fix things that need fixing.</li>
            <li>Better way to interface with system code, XS doesn't cut it.</li>
            <li>Cononical spec that allows for multiple implementations.</li>
            <li>Removal of ambiguity. Example: '{}' is this a function, or a hashref?</li>
        </ul>

        <b>Core Library:</b><br>
        This is the specification that every GSD
        implementation must provide. This should be small; Things should only
        be added to core when necesary to introduce new capabilities. If
        something can be done as a module, it should be done as a module.

        <p>

        <b>Standard Library:</b><br>
        This is a collection of modules that the core
        developers have decided to adopt. Any distribution of GSD should
        include these modules.

        <p>

        <b>Community Library:</b><br>
        This is a collection of modules assembled by the community, Core
        developers do not have exclusive control of what makes it into this
        library. A voting system of some kind will be built for this.
